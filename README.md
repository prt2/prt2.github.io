##### MIT License:
###### I chose the MIT License because it is one of the simplest, most permissive, and highly adopted open-source licenses. It allows others to use freely, modify, distribute, even commercially, with the only condition being that the original license has to be included. This makes it flexible for further development, with due respect for the developers of the original code.
